**Message:** fix: improve visual documentation capture reliability

SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:
- Remove complex visibility checks that were causing timeouts
- Use simple domcontentloaded + fixed timeout (approach that worked before)
- Force body visibility without complex selector checking

SERVER STARTUP IMPROVEMENTS:
- Build app before starting preview server
- Increase startup wait time to 15 seconds
- Add retry logic with 10 attempts
- Use npx vite preview directly instead of npm script
- Better status checking with curl retries

This returns to the simple approach that was working successfully before,
while improving server startup reliability in CI environment.
