# Archived Azure Deployment Files

This folder contains Azure deployment configurations that were explored but not used in the final implementation.

## Why Archived?

The project uses **Vercel + Supabase + Lovable.dev** for deployment, making Azure configurations unnecessary.

## Archived Files:

- `azure-database-setup.md` - Azure PostgreSQL setup guide
- Various deployment scripts and configurations

## Current Stack:

- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Development**: Lovable.dev

These files are kept for reference only and are not part of the active codebase.
