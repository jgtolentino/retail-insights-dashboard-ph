-- 2. Create customer analytics view  
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_analytics AS

-- 5. Create daily trends view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW daily_trends AS

-- 6. Create product performance view (for Product Insights)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW product_performance AS

FROM products p
LEFT JOIN brands b ON b.id = p.brand_id
LEFT JOIN transaction_items ti ON ti.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, b.name, p.category;

-- 7. Grant permissions to all views
GRANT SELECT ON brand_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON customer_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON basket_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON substitution_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON daily_trends TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON product_performance TO anon;

-- 8. Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transaction_items_brand_category ON transaction_items(brand_id, category);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transaction_items_product_id ON transaction_items(product_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transactions_created_at ON transactions(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transactions_customer_age ON transactions(customer_age);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_substitutions_transaction ON substitutions(transaction_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_brand_id ON products(brand_id);
