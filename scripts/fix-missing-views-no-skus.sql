-- 1. Create brand_analytics view (SIMPLIFIED)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW brand_analytics AS

-- 2. Create customer analytics view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_analytics AS

    EXTRACT(dow FROM t.created_at) as day_of_week
FROM transactions t
WHERE t.customer_age IS NOT NULL;

-- 3. Create basket analytics view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW basket_analytics AS

    SUM(ti.quantity) as total_quantity,
    SUM(ti.quantity * ti.price) as basket_value,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ti.category, ', ' ORDER BY ti.category) as categories

GROUP BY ti.transaction_id;

-- 4. Create substitution analytics view (SIMPLIFIED without SKUs)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW substitution_analytics AS
SELECT

-- 5. Create daily trends view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW daily_trends AS
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_transaction_value,
    COUNT(DISTINCT store_location) as active_stores
FROM transactions
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- 6. Grant permissions to all views
GRANT SELECT ON brand_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON customer_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON basket_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON substitution_analytics TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON daily_trends TO anon;

-- 7. Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transaction_items_brand_category ON transaction_items(brand_id, category);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transactions_created_at ON transactions(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transactions_customer_age ON transactions(customer_age);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_substitution_events_transaction ON substitution_events(transaction_id);
